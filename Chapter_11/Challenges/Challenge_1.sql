# Challenge 1

/*
Using a subquery, return a list of customers who bought items priced 10 or
 more. Youâ€™ll want to use the OrderItems table to find the matching order 
 numbers (order_num) and then the Orders table to retrieve the customer ID 
 (cust_id) for those matched orders.
*/

SELECT cust_id
FROM Orders
WHERE order_num IN (SELECT order_num
					FROM OrderItems
                    WHERE quantity >=10);
