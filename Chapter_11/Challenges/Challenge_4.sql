# Challenge 4

/*
We need a list of customer IDs with the total amount they have 
ordered. Write a SQL statement to return customer ID 
(cust_id in the Orders table) and total_ordered using a 
subquery to return the total of orders for each customer. 
Sort the results by amount spent from greatest to the least. 
Hint: youâ€™ve used the SUM() to calculate order totals previously.
