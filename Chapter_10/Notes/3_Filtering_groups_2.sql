/*
This statement warrants an explanation. The first line is a
 basic SELECT using an aggregate functionâ€”much like the examples 
 thus far. The WHERE clause filters all rows with a prod_price 
 of at least 4. Data is then grouped by vend_id, and then a 
 HAVING clause filters just those groups with a count of 2 or 
 more.
